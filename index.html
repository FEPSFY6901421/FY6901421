    Aircraft fuel efficiency has evolved through years of innovation. Early planes with piston engines have limited range and speed. Then turbojet engines got introduced after World War II increasing the speed and altitude but they consume a lot of fuel. In the 1960s, we saw the development of the turbofan engines which improved efficiency, reduced noise, and allowed for more long-haul commercial travel as we seen with the Boeing 747. In the 70s and 80s, rising fuel costs led to aerodynamic innovations such as winglets, which reduced drag and allowed aircraft like the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 to burn less fuel per mile. These advancements allowed for aviation to be more efficient and sustainable.

    Aviation is widely recognised as one of the most technologically advanced and inventive sectors of engineering. While aeroplanes are based on the fundamental idea of lift, their design and functionality include complicated considerations such as weight distribution, aerodynamics, fuel efficiency, and a variety of other aspects. What started as a pioneering demonstration by the Wright brothers in 1903 has grown into the creation of enormous aircraft capable of transcontinental travel, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777. This poses critical questions, how has aviation evolved from the Wright Flyer to the fuel-intensive machines of today? And how can the industry reduce its environmental impact? This article examines the evolution of aircraft design, focussing on the progress achieved towards higher fuel efficiency throughout time.

    In the early 1920s and 1930s, most aircraft were powered by piston engines, which heavily relied on gasoline. This dependence on fuel presented significant challenges, particularly during periods of military and commercial demand for aviation. Wartime conditions exacerbated fuel scarcity due to political constraints, making access to the required resources difficult. Additionally, the rising demand for long-haul flights highlighted another limitation: the restricted flight range and low speeds of piston-engine aircraft, constrained by their limited fuel capacity. These challenges were effectively addressed in the post-World War II period with the advent of the jet engine, ushering in a new era of aviation.  
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    The introduction of the turbojet and the use of it on popular commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 revolutionised air travel as it allowed for aircraft to travel at higher speeds and altitudes. But, with this new jet age came a new issue. The engines used up a lot of fuel burning significantly more fuel per mile than the piston engines. This issue was solved by engineers in the 60s through the introduction of the turbofan engine. The main difference was that now only a portion of air gets allowed into the combustion chamber allowing for greater fuel efficiency and being better at lower airspeeds. Other benefits also included that the turbofan was quieter than the turbojets and that it was economically more viable allowing long haul flights to be more affordable. We saw this with the introduction of the famous Boeing 747 which allowed hundreds of passengers to travel using the turbofan engine. Although it was still costly as it still used a lot of fuel despite the efficiency increase.
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    In the 70s and 80s, with the rising fuel prices and the increase in environmental awareness made engineers think of further ways to increase fuel efficiency. A lot of new technology and focus was spent on improving the engine but during this period, we saw the focus change to more aerodynamics. We see this through the introduction of winglets on aircraft which help reduce drag and improve lift. This increases fuel efficiency as aircraft can maintain higher speeds with less thrust. We see that aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 have been equipped with these new innovations making them some of the most cost-friendly and popular aircraft to airlines as they burn less fuel per mile.
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    Another factor that affects fuel efficiency is the weight of an aircraft. Using lightweight materials has been one of the most pivotal advancements in fuel efficiency. Initially, planes were made using materials such as aluminum, but this has been now replaced by composites such as carbon fibre which weighs less and is stronger. The latest planes like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is 50% made up of composites. This allows it to consume around 20% less fuel compared to its previous counterparts. Similarly, the Airbus A350 is made up of 54% composites whilst still being able to carry up to 350 passengers and burns 25% less fuel than its previous generation of planes.
  </p>

  <p class="ex1">
    Aviation is projected to become more fuel efficient in the future. Future developments could include improved aerodynamic designs, lighter materials, and alternative fuel sources. We see an increase in research and development towards hydrogen-powered engines and electric engines like Airbus is doing with ZEROe. With the aim being to go fully green and have the first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035.
  </p>
  
  <p class="ex1">
    The journey of aircraft fuel efficiency has been constantly filled by innovation due to economic, technological, and environmental reasons. From the piston engine to the modern composite-based turbofan aircraft. And even changes in the design of the aircraft such as the introduction of winglets to reduce drag. Every few decades we have seen improvements being made to make air travel more fuel-efficient and less damaging for the environment. With the rise of sustainable aviation fuels, electric propulsion, and new materials, the future of aviation sees sustainability as the driving force for the next generation of aircraft. And the central focus of this drive is fuel efficiency.
